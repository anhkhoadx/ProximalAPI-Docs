##Proximal API v2.0 - Aditional Notes

###Email to a Wireless Name

Emailing to a wireless name is possible using the format WirelessName@WirelessRegistry.com or HarwareID@WirelessRegistry.com

###Wireless Name Public URL for public Pins

All wireless strings may have public content associated with them and this content can be seen at www.WirelessRegistry.com/Name or www.WirelessRegistry.com/HardwareID. This page shows...

###Wireless Technology and Spectrum

Note that the wireless signals in question are independent of the technology or spectrum then are transmitted on. A wireless name can be transmitted on Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, BLE, LTE-Direct or any other technology on any spectrum.
     
###Tilde

Throughout the documentation and in recommended use-cases you will note the use of the tilde "~". This character will be used as an indicator of a wireless name (~MyWirelessName) as well as a separator between wireless names and a related hardware ID (MyWirelessName~AB:12:AB:12:AB:12).
 
###Pin Ownership, overall data ownership

The Wireless Registry considers all data in the system to be owned and controlled by the registered wirless string owners. This means registrants of a wireless name control all Public pins at all times. HardwareID registrants similarly control all pins, both Standard pins and Custom pins. Developers can freely add pins to any wireless signal at no cost and aslo query the system without restriction or cost - and the Registry and API infrasture of The Wireless Registry will automatically ensure the pins respect the privacy settings and control requests of all Wireless Name and Hardware ID owners. The infrastructure will adjust pins as required to meet the requests and privacy of the owners while maximizing the usefullness and availability for all wireless device software developers.
